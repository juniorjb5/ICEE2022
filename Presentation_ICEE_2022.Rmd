Diapo 3: Motivación



Understanding the causes or generation of company profitability is a topic of interest in the academic and business world. 

Although, different companies may in turn present different causes or events that determine their profitability, depending on the structure of assets, or financial structure or operations or composition of assets. 

We could mainly identify two foci of the determinants.

In the first place, the internal determinants are associated with the characteristics of the companies. And secondly, the external determinants are associated with aspects that are not controlled by the company's management but that clearly influence decision-making or management strategies.

Diapo 4: Motivación

The importance of profitability lies in its relevance as an indicator of efficient management in terms of utility and benefit for companies. 

In the case of the energy companies, we found a big difference in their composition and management strategies, mainly by the sources of generation as to oil, wind, water or solar. This generates different strategies to maximize the value of the companies due to their operation.

Different authors have identified Internal aspects or idiosyncratic characteristics as firms' age, or size, financial leverage, etc., and the external determinants can be fuel prices, interest rates, exchange rates, economic activity, etc. Many other internal and external measurable characteristics can be listed.

Diapo 6: Metodología

We have structured 3 methodological stages.

First, we construct a common factor from different developed market interest rates. This factor is called the world interest rate and is our indicator of global liquidity. WIR in short form.

Second, we estimate a common factor of profitability for firms in each subsector. We do this using Principal Functional Component Analysis.

Third, we measure the effect of global liquidity on profitability using the nonlinear distributed lag model. An advantage of this analysis is to observe the effect through the lags of the predictor variable.

# Factor analysis by principal components (PCA)


<br>

.pull-left[

.font120[

The PCA method comes from `Hotelling (1933)` and gained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s (e.g., `Jolliffe (1986)`; `Lawley and Maxwell (1971)`).


We take the first component as the world interest rate. We estimate $WIR_j$ $(j = 1,...,p)$ where each $WIR_j$ is a linear combination of the original variables. In this case, the long and short-term interest rates are given by $w_1,w_2,...,w_p$, hence:

]
]

.pull-right[

.font120[



$$\begin{align}
{WIR}_j & =    a_{j1}w_1+ a_{j2}w_2+\ldots + a_{jp}w_p \nonumber \\
        & =   \mathrm{a}_j^\prime\mathrm{w}
\end{align}$$

<br>

where $\mathrm{a}_j^\prime=(a_{1j}, a_{2j}, \ldots, a_{pj})$ a vector of constants, and $w$ a vector of global interest rates.

$$\begin{equation}\mathrm{W}= \begin{bmatrix}
w_1 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
w_p
\end{bmatrix}\end{equation}$$

]
]


#???

Diapo 11: Metodología

Explaining a little our methodology. The technique used for the construction of WIR is the analysis of principal components, which allows us to generate, through a linear combination, a component that summarizes a large part of the variability of interest rates in the developed markets.

# Functional principals components analysis

<br>

.font120[

We use sparse functional data methods to reconstruct the whole history of profitability for all firms in the dataset. This can be expressed following `Yao et al. (2005)` like: 


$$\begin{equation}
X_i\left(t\right)=\mu\left(t\right)+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty\ }{\xi_{ik}\varphi_k\left(t\right)}
\end{equation}$$

where $\xi_{ik}$ are functional principal components for $X_i\left(t\right)$  (i.e. underlaying series), and $\varphi_1, \varphi_2, \ldots$ are the corresponding orthonormal eigenfunctions.

The entire data set is used to estimate the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions in the following way:

$$\begin{equation}
{\hat{\xi}}_{ik}=E[\xi_{ik}|\tilde{\boldsymbol{Y}}_i] = {\hat{\lambda}}_k{\hat{\varphi}}_{ik}^T {\hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}}_i^{-1}\left({\tilde{{\boldsymbol{Y}}}}_i-{\hat{{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}}_i\right)
\end{equation}$$

where ${\hat{{\Sigma}}}_i=\ {\hat{{G}}}_i+\sigma^2{I}$, and ${\tilde{{Y}}}_i=\left(Y_{i1},\ \ldots,\ Y_{iN_i}\right)^T$.

Diapo 7: Data

Our data on the profitability of energy companies and the macroeconomic interest rate environment come from two different sources.

We use ROA, which is Return on Assets, ROA measures the operating efficiency of a company.

We have 536 companies, with greater participation of Oil and Gas companies, then, companies related to equipment and services, renewable energies, coal and uranium.


We use short and long-term interest rates for 21 countries of developed economies regarding global liquidity information.


Finally, we present the distribution of the companies in our sample. The US and Canada stand out with 255 and 114 respectively. This map allows visualizing that geographically our sample is well distributed.

Diapo 9: Results

Subsequently, this figure is the result of the DLNM method. Here, we present the response surface which has 3 dimensions. Profitability, WIR and Lag.

In this case, we can see that the strongest effects occur when WIR is negative. Also, we can see how the effect changes over the delays. But, reading these graphs in 3d is usually somewhat complex. That is why it is better to present contour plots.

# Effect global liquidity on profitability


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%" }
knitr::include_graphics("img/contour.png")
```

???

Diapo 10: Results

Here we can compare the behavior of the estimated effect for each subsector. We point out that the effect is not symmetric, that is, the behavior when the WIR decreases is not the same when the WIR increases, (remember.. decreases in WIR represent increases in the global liquidity).


We can identify that the Oil and Gas sector is the most sensitive in the first lags to increases in global liquidity.


This figure presents contour plots that summarize the response of ROA to changes in global liquidity in different energy subsectors. In general, we find that decreases in the world interest rate (WIR) are associated with higher profitability in all sectors, except for uranium. For the coal subsector, the figure shows that the main effect on profitability occurs over the first two quarters, after which the shock stabilizes. In the case where the WIR increases, slight tendencies to increase profitability are observed in the equipment and services of Oil and Gas, but the effect is not strong. The same in renewable energy.

The effect of global liquidity on the profitability of energy companies is completely non-linear, that is, asymmetric.



The profitability of energy companies is affected differently depending on their sub-sector relative to global liquidity... ehmm, This is mainly due to the financing structure of the companies.

Increases in global liquidity, i.e., negative WIR, present stronger effects on profitability, but these are not persistent over time. We were able to identify that the impact on profitability is observed mainly during the first and third quarters.



Uranium companies show strong positive effects on profitability given changes in global liquidity (ie negative WIR). It is important to delve into the financial and equity structure of these companies.
